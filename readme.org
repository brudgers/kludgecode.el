There is a /Github Pages page/ for this project at: https://brudgers.github.io/gps_py/ which is the /woven/ representation of the project. My companion version of this project in Common Lisp can be found at: https://github.com/brudgers/general-problem-solver. 

** Literate Programming
This project utilizes Emacs' [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] and in particular the system [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Babel]] to implement active programming. I think of active programmng as an extension of Donald Knuth's [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf][literate programming]] paradigam. 

The primary source for this project is =kludgecode.org=. Other than this =readme.org= and similar administrativia, most other files in this repository are /tangled/ from =gps_py.org=.
